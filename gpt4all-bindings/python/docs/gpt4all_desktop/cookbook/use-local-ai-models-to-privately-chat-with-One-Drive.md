## How It Works

OneDrive for Desktop syncs your OneDrive files to your computer, while LocalDocs maintains a database of these synced files for use by your local GPT4All model. As your OneDrive updates, LocalDocs will automatically detect file changes and stay up to date. LocalDocs leverages [Nomic Embedding](https://docs.nomic.ai/atlas/capabilities/embeddings) models to find semantically similar snippets from your files, enhancing the context of your interactions.
